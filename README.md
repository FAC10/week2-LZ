# week2-LZ
Stopwatch project for week 2.

## Initial plan
* Did 30 min technical spike to research how to actually make a timer in javascript
  * found the `setInterval()` method which we will use as the basis for a timer
* Discussed concept of timer, decided to aim toward a 20/20/20 timer
  * functionality would be a timer with three sections, each set at 0 to start with that display minutes and seconds, with a start and a stop button. The start button will start one of the timers, when that timer reaches 20 minutes it stops, gives an audio notification and starts the next timer, the same happens when the next timer reaches 20 minutes and so on.
  * stretch goals:
    * add changing colours to timers to as they go from unset-running-finished
    * add responsiveness
    * add pulsing animation to timer at each minute interval

## Goals
* Day one
  * Have one functioning clock in JS (with a good suite of tests from TDD :wink:) showing milliseconds, seconds and minutes
* Day two
  * Get the full 20/20/20 timer working
